Replies to Philippe Jorion </b></font>
</p>

<p class="msonormal"><b>Copyright 1997 by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</b></p>

Since then I have been calling Jorion a certified charlatan based on
evidence from subsequent events.<br>

<p><font size="6"><b>P</b></font>hilippe Jorion is perhaps the most
credible member of the pro-VAR camp. I will answer his criticism
while expanding on some of the more technical statements I made
during the interview (DS, December/January 1997). Indeed, while
Philippe Jorion and I agree on many core points, we mainly disagree
on the conclusion: mine is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">suspend
the current version of the VAR
as potentially dangerous malpractice </span>while his is to supplement
it
with other methods.</p>

<p>My refutation of the VAR does not mean that I am against
quantitative risk management - having spent all of my adult life as a
quantitative trader, I learned the hard way the fails of such
methods. I am simply against the application of unseasonned
quantitative methods. I think that VAR would be a wonderful
measurement if we had models designed for that purpose and knew
something about their parameters. The validity of VAR is linked to
the problem of probabilistic measurement of future events,
particularly those deemed infrequent (more than 2 standard
deviations) and those that concern multiple securities. I conjecture
that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the methods we currently use to
measure such tail probabilities
are flawed.</span></p>

<p>The definition I used for the VAR came from the informative book
by Philippe Jorion, "It summarizes the expected maximum loss (or
worst loss) over a target horizon within a given confidence
interval". It is the uniqueness, precision and misplaced
concreteness of the measure that bother me. I would rather hear risk
managers make statements like "at such price in such security A
and at such price in security B, we will be down $150,000". They
should present a list of such associated crisis scenarios without
unduly attaching probabilities to the array of events, until such
time as we can show a better grasp of probability of large deviations
for portfolios and better confidence with our measurement of
"confidence levels". There is an internal contradiction
between measuring risk (i.e. standard deviation) and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">using a tool
with a higher standard error than that of the measure itself</span>. </p>

<p>I find that those professional risk managers whom I heard
recommend a "guarded" use of the VAR on grounds that it
"generally works" or "it works on average" do not
share my definition of risk management. The risk management objective
function is survival, not profits and losses ( see rule-of-thumb 8 ).
A trader according to the Chicago legend, "made 8 million in
eight years and lost 80 million in eight minutes". According to
the same standards, he would be, "in general", and "on
average" a good risk manager. </p>

<p>Nor am I swayed with the usual argument that the VAR' s
wide-spread use by financial institutions should give it a measure of
scientific credibility. Banks have the ingrained habit of plunging
headlong into mistakes together where blame-minimizing managers
appear to feel comfortable making blunders so long as their
competitors are making the same ones. The state of the Japanese and
French banking systems, the stories of lending to Latin America, the
chronic real estate booms and bust and the S&amp;L debacle provide us
with an interesting cycle of communal irrationality. I believe that
the VAR is the alibi bankers will give shareholders (and the
bailing-out taxpayer) to show documented due diligence and will
express that their blow-up came from <i>truly unforeseeable
circumstances</i> <span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>events
with low probability</i> <span style="font-style: normal;">- not from
taking large risks they did not understand. But my sense of social
responsibility will force me to menacingly point my finger. I
maintain that the due-diligence VAR tool encourages untrained people
to take misdirected risk with the shareholder's, and ultimately the
taxpayer's, money. </span>
</p>

<p>The act of reducing risk to one simple quantitative measure on
grounds that "everyone can understand" it clashes with my
culture. As rule-of-thumb 1 from "trader lore" recommends:
<i>do not venture in businesses and markets you do not understand.</i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">I have no sympathy for warned people
who lose money in these circumstances. </span>
</p>

<p>Praising VAR because it would have prevented the Orange County and
P&amp;G debacles is a stretch. Many VAR defenders made a similar
mistake. These events arose from issues of extreme leverage -and
leverage is a deterministic, not a probabilistic, measurement. If my
leverage is ten to one, a 10% move can bankrupt me. A Wall Street
clerk would have picked up these excesses using an abacus. VAR
defenders make it look like the only solution where there are simpler
and more reliable ones. We should not does not allow the acceptance
of a solution on casual corroboration without first ascertaining
whether more elementary ones are available (like one you can keep on
a napkin). </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I disagree with the statement that
"the degree of precision
in daily volatility is much higher than that in daily return".
My observations show that the one week volatility of volatility is
generally between 5 and 50 times higher than the one week volatility
(too high for the normal kurtosis). Nor do I believe that the
ARCH-style modeling of heteroskedasticity that appeared to work in
research papers, but has so far failed in many dealing rooms, can be
relied upon for risk management. The fact that the precision of the
risk measure (volatility) is volatile and intractable is sufficient
reason to discourage us from such a quantitative venture. I would
accept VAR if indeed volatility were easy to forecast with a low
standard error</span>.<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial"><i><b>The Science of
Misplaced Concreteness <br>
</b></i></font><font size="6">O</font>n the
apology of engineering, I would like to stress that the applications
of its methods to the social sciences in the name of progress have
lead to economic and human disasters. The critics of my position
resemble the Marxist defenders of a more "scientific"
society who seized the day in the '60s, who portrayed Von Hayek as
backward and "unscientific". I hold that, in economics, and
the social sciences, engineering has been the science of <i><b>misplaced
and misdirected concreteness. </b></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">Perhaps
old J.M. Keynes had the insight of the problem when he wrote: "
To convert a model into a quantitative formula is to destroy its
usefulness as an instrument of thought." </span></span>
</p>

<p>If financial engineering means the creation of financial
instruments that improve risk allocation, then I am in favor of it.
If it means using engineering methods to quantify the immeasurable
with great precision, then I am against it.</p>

<p>During the interview I was especially careful to require
technology to be "flawless", not "perfect". While
perfection is unattainable, flawlessness can be, as it is a
methodological consideration and refers to the applicability for the
task at hand. </p>

<p>Marshall, Allais and Coase used the term <i><b>charlatanism</b></i>
<span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">to
describe the concealment of a poor understanding of economics with
mathematical smoke. Using VAR before 1985 was simply the result of a
lack of insight into statistical inference. Given the fact that it
has been falsified in 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995,
it can be safely pronounced plain charlatanism. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The prevalence of
between 7 and 30 standard deviations events (using whatever
information on parameters was available </span></span></span><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">prior</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">to
the event)</span> can convince the jury that the model is wrong. A
hypothesis testing between the validity of the model and the rarity
of the events would certainly reject the hypothesis of the rare
events. <br>
<br>
</span></span><font face="Arial"><i><b>Trading as
Clinical Research</b></i></font></p>

<p><font size="6">W</font>hy do I put trader lore high above
"scientific" methods ? Some of my friends hold that [<span style="font-weight: bold;">option</span>] trading
is lab-coat scientific research. I go beyond that and state that
traders are clinical researchers, like medical doctors working on
real patients --a more truth revealing approach than simulated
laboratory experiments. An opinionated econometrician will show you
(and will produce) the data that will confirm his side of the story
(or his departmental party line ). I hold that active trading is the
only close to data-mining free approach to understand financial
markets. You only have one life and cannot back-fit your experience.
As a result, <i><b>clinical experiences</b></i> <span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">of
the sort are not just the best verifiable accounts of the accuracy of
a method: they are the only ones. Whatever the pecuniary motivation,
trading is a disciplined truth-seeking proposition. We are trained to
look into reality's garbage can, not into the elegant world of
models. Unlike professional researchers, traders are never tempted to
relax assumptions to make their model more tractable.</span></span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Option traders present the additional
attribute of making their
living trading the statistical properties of the distribution,
therefore carefully observing all of its higher order wrinkles. They
are rational researchers who deal with the unobstructed Truth for a
living and get (but only in the long term) their paycheck from the
Truth without the judgment or agency of the more human and fallible
scientific committee.</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><i><b>Charlatanism: a Technical Argument</b></i></font></p>

<p><font size="5">A</font>t a more philosophical level, the casual
quantitative inference in current use is too incomplete a method.
Rule 1 conjectures that there is no "canned" standard way
to explore stressful events: they never look alike since humans
adjust. It is indeed hard to conciliate standard naive inference
(based on past frequencies) and the dialectic of historical events
(people adjust). The crash of 1987 caused a sharp rally in the bonds.
This became a trap during the mini-crash of 1989 ( I was caught
myself ). <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem with the
adjustments to VAR by "fattening
the tails" as an after-the-fact adaptation to stressful events
that happened is dangerously naive. </span>Thus the VAR is like a
Maginot
line. In other words there is a tautological link between the harm of
the events and their unpredictability, since harm comes from
surprise. As rule-of-thumb 2 conjectures (see Box), nothing
predictable can be truly harmful and nothing truly harmful can be
predictable. We may be endowed with enough rationality to heed past
events (people rationally remember events that hurt them). </p>

<p>Furthermore, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the simplified
mean-variance paradigm was designed as
a tool to understand the world, not to quantify risk (it failed in
both).</span> This explains its survival in financial economics as a
pedagogical tool for MBA students. It is therefore too idealized for
risk management, which requires higher moment analysis. It also
ignores the forays made by market microstructure theory. As a market
maker, the fact of having something in your portfolio can be more
potent information than all of its past statistical properties:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">securities do not randomly land in
portfolios </span>. A bank's position
increase in a Mexican security signifies an increase in the
probability of devaluation . The position might originate from the
niece of an informed government official trading with a local bank.
For having been picked on routinely traders (who survived the sitting
duck stage) adjust for these asymmetric information biases better
than the "scientific" engineer.</p>

<p>The greatest risk we face is therefore that of the
mis-specification of financial price dynamics by the available
models. The 2 standard deviations (and higher) <span style="font-weight: bold;">VAR is very sensitive
to model specification</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
sensitivity is compounded with every
additional increase in dimension (i.e. in the number of securities
included). For portfolios of 75 securities (a small portfolio for a
trading room), I have seen frequent 7 and higher standard deviation
variations during quiet markets.</span> Thus VAR is not adapted for the
brand of diversified leverage we usually take in trading firms. This
risk I call the risk of <i>incompleteness</i> <span style="font-style: normal;">issue,
or the model risk. A model might show you some risks, but not the
risks of using it. Moreover, models are built on a finite set of
parameters, while reality affords us infinite sources of risks. </span>
</p>

<p>Options may or may not deliver an estimation of the consensus on
volatility and correlations. We can compute, in some markets, some
transition probabilities and, in some currency pairs with liquid
crosses, joint transition probabilities (hence local correlation). We
cannot, however, use such pricing kernels as gospel. Option traders
do not have perfect foresight, and, as much as I would like them to,
cannot be considered prophets. Why should their forecast of the
second moment be superior to that of a forward trader's future price
?</p>

<p>I only see one use of covariance matrices: in speculative trading,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">where the bets are on the first moment
of the marginal distributions,</span>
and where operators rely on the criticized "trader lore"
for higher moments. Such technique, which I call generalized pairs
trading, has been carried in the past with large measure of success
by "kids with Brooklyn accent". A use of the covariance
matrix that is humble enough to limit itself to conditional
expectations (not risks of tail events) is acceptable, provided it is
handled by someone with the critical and rigorous mind that develops
from the observation of, and experimentation with, real-time market
events. </p>
